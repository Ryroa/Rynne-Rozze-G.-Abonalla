The Yakan Village is found at Upper Calarian, Labuan - Limpapa National Road, Zamboanga. They are the first inhabitants of the Basilan province and are considered to be one of the finest weavers in the Philippines. According to a Yakan they use the “huli” and “sulip” type of thread for their weaving.

 Most of the designs are colorful geometric patterns. The standard time to finish a meter of cloth is about one week, depending on the design details. Yakans weave table runners, place mats, coasters, wallets and bags, just to name a few.
